Lucky_Enigma is a meticulously crafted symmetric encryption project that I’ve been working on in my spare time. It utilizes a systematic approach for both encryption and decryption, providing robust and reliable data protection. While it's still a work in progress, I’m committed to refining and enhancing it as I continue to dedicate time to its development.


Update: 
2/26/2025  - Currently I am working on Version 9 of Lucky_Enigma. However, at this point I've decided not to release it to the general public.
