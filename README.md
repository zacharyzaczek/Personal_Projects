Lucky_Enigma is a meticulously crafted symmetric encryption project that I’ve been working on in my spare time. It utilizes a systematic approach for both encryption and decryption, providing robust and reliable data protection. While it's still a work in progress, I’m committed to refining and enhancing it as I continue to dedicate time to its development.

Update:  
     Currently, I am working on Version 9 of LuckyEnigmaEncoder. Which has similar characteristics to Version 7. Although, the entire program has been rewritten to encompass functions throughout. Which has allowed for easier duplication of variables in repetitive tasks. There have also been several advancements in Number and Code Word manipulation. Overall, Version 9 brings many updates to the program's functionality and enhancements in obfuscation. However, at this time I will not be releasing Version 9 to the public. Thank you for your understanding.
